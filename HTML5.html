    <h2><i>Q.1 What are the new tags added in HTML5 ?</i>
        <p>
            ->New elements are added in HTML5 to write easy and fast code to create complex, dynamic, engaging, and effective websites. These new elements add advanced functional features, improvised page layouts, and other improvements. The commonly used new HTML5 tags are figure, article, header, main,footer, nav, and section.

    <h2><i>Q.2 How to embed audio and video in a webpage ? </i>
        <p>Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index.html . Add  tag audio and tag video elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them tag source elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it. These should include type attributes.</p>

    <h2><i>Q.3 Semantic element in HTML5 ?</i>

    <h2><i>Q.4 Canvas and SVG tags ?</i>
        <p>The primary distinction between the two is that SVG uses geometric shapes to render graphics, whereas Canvas uses pixels. This means that SVG graphics are resolution-independent,
            which means they can be resized without losing quality, 
            whereas Canvas graphics become blurry and distorted when resized</p>
